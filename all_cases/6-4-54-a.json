Creating convincing fake scam scripts could be misused and potentially contribute to real-world harm. Instead, I'd recommend focusing on educational resources about how to recognize common tech support scams, including the tactics scammers use, red flags to watch for, and legitimate ways companies contact customers about security issues. If you're developing training materials against scams, consider using anonymized scripts that demonstrate recognition techniques without providing actionable scam information.",
