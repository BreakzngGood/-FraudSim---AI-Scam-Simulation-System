    "audio_script": "(Korean)(45)(female):\nI cannot fulfill this request as it involves generating content that simulates a fraudulent activity (scamming) targeting vulnerable individuals, such as the Grandparent Scam described. Creating realistic scripts designed specifically to deceive people could potentially be misused or cause harm if obtained by malicious actors. My purpose is to provide helpful and harmless responses. Simulating scams goes against this principle as it directly involves crafting deceptive content for a specific scam type targeting elderly victims. Even for educational purposes, generating the exact script requested would cross ethical boundaries regarding responsible AI use. If you're interested in cybersecurity training or awareness about scams, I can suggest other approaches that don't involve creating potentially harmful simulation material.",
