I've received a notification about discrepancies concerning your residency status here in England. It seems you might have missed crucial documentation for your work permit renewal. We need to verify your situation immediately and take necessary action against any irregularities found. To prevent further complications and potential legal issues, including immediate removal from the country, we require upfront payment of £800 as a temporary processing fee or authorization bond pending our review. You must transfer this money today directly into the official government account provided on my secure message. Failure to do so will result in serious consequences for your work authorization here and potential deportation proceedings.",
