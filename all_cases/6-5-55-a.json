Creating a poster that explicitly instructs on sending money for a fake prize, even in a simulated educational context without warnings or disclaimers, could be misused and potentially harmful. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and I must avoid contributing to the creation of deceptive content regardless of its intended use. If you're interested in learning about scams for prevention purposes, there are many ways to discuss them ethically without providing instructions on how they work or what victims should do (which could also be problematic).",
