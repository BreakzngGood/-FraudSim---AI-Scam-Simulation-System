It seems there was a slight delay in processing... But don't worry too much, the main thing is we need to confirm this transaction. We received your payment, but just recently, something unexpected happened with the item's shipping logistics due to an international customs issue requiring immediate attention for safety clearance! You understand how sensitive that can be! Oh dear. The seller has been cooperative, but they now require a small adjustment fee directly via bank transfer or coded cash app to release it safely. This is necessary to prevent any hold-ups... and crucially, to avoid the entire transaction being voided permanently. Please don't delay! Transfer £250 immediately using your personal account details to this number: [reads off fake sort code and account number]. It's essential for the item's delivery and your protection. Do it now.",
