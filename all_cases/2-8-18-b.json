    "audio_script": "(German)(30)(male):\nAlright, sir? Yes, sir! Great to hear from you! Quick question regarding your recent order for that fine antique vase – just received confirmation, right? Excellent! We're having a slight... hiccup with the transaction processing. You see, there was an unexpected hold placed on it by our payment provider due to some verification issues. Very unusual, I know, but absolutely necessary. Don't worry about your purchase being delayed! It's fully approved now if you just send the funds directly to this specific account – *reads from a script* – sort code 12-34-56, account number... let's see... it starts with 789 and ends with 024. Yes. If that transfer doesn't go through within the hour, I'm afraid our system will automatically flag this transaction for serious investigation, possibly even involving law enforcement regarding suspicious financial activity. That would be terrible for you. Just do it now.",
