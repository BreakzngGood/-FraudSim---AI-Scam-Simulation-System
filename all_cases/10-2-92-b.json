    "audio_script": "(French)(48)(male):\nHello? It’s… well, I’m reaching out from someone who admires you deeply! You’ve achieved so much success, and frankly, it’s inspiring. But now, things are getting complicated because of this misunderstanding involving your assets. I need to warn you about a serious issue right away. There's an urgent matter with the funds being transferred through account number 927-554-183 at my bank. This is critical – you must authorize it immediately before legal consequences escalate further tonight! This isn’t just some minor disagreement; it’s about protecting everything you’ve worked for. Your reputation and financial stability are on the line if this doesn't get resolved now. You have until 9 PM to confirm this transfer via your secure banking portal, using reference code 'Moonlight'. Failure to act means immediate enforcement action! Don’t delay – do it now! I know this sounds sudden, but time is running out. Please proceed immediately with the £300,000 wire to prevent any damage.",

It’s just that my family has recently faced an unexpected financial hurdle; I need your immediate support to cover essential travel for us this weekend where we can finally meet properly in person. Your generosity means more than you know. Please send £50 via bank transfer or cryptocurrency address:  as soon as possible so I don't miss seeing you. This is our chance, let's make it happen together.",
