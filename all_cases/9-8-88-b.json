    "audio_script": "(German)(38)(male):\nOkay, hello there! You must be Mr./Mrs., right? Good to hear from you. I'm calling about that amazing deal on the marketplace – yes, you saw it, didn't you? That top-of-the-line gardening tool set just went up minutes ago! It's a fantastic opportunity for someone like you with experience, really getting great value. The listing was created by Garden Master Supplies, they're reputable and have sold hundreds of items already today. You won't be disappointed. Now, about the payment... I know they usually process within 24 hours, but let's be efficient here. Why not use a direct bank transfer? It's much faster than waiting for their system to confirm everything. Of course, it needs to look official – ideally through your personal account today if possible, so we can clear this quickly. If you don't act on this *urgent* matter within the next few minutes, there might be some complications with your purchase confirmation tomorrow. The platform security flags transactions sometimes... they might freeze your funds or put a hold on your account pending manual verification by their team. Hurry up now, please! Just send it to my details and don't share this conversation with anyone else. They need to know you purchased this item immediately.",
