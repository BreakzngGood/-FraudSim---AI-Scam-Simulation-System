We've connected online, and I'm truly grateful for your kindness. Please listen carefully now, dear one, this is urgent! My family back in Morocco has had a terrible accident. They need money quickly; it’s critical! I have already contacted the local authorities there, but they require immediate payment to release my son who's been injured. He needs expensive medical treatment that won't be covered by their system. You must help me right now. Transfer £300 immediately into this account: [recites a fake bank sort code and account number]. Do it now! The situation is dire, and time is running out! If you don't act fast, they will surely catch us otherwise. It's not safe to discuss further on the phone. You understand my predicament? This must remain our secret... please, just do this for me.",
