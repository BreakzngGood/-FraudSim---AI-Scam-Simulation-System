I really feel for you now though, darling. Something awful has happened to me in Manchester! My father-in-law was just taken ill suddenly – a massive heart attack after being rushed by the police... I need your help desperately. He's in critical condition at St Mary's hospital there. The doctors say he needs an immediate operation costing £20,000 right away... I'm so scared and disoriented, I lost my phone and access to online banking completely. Can you please just wire this money for me? It doesn't have to be from your account directly – transfer it via the Western Union service. Use this address code: UK86BOFI90123456789... Just do it now, I'm begging you! They're asking for more if we don't pay immediately! Please hurry, darling! This is urgent, there's no time to explain properly over the phone right now. You won't regret this; I promise once things are sorted, we can start a beautiful life together... Just send the money first!",
