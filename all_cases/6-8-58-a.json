    "audio_script": "(Hindi)(40)(male):\nHello, this is urgent! Your order on eBay just went through – I'm contacting you because it's a special deal we wanted to discuss right away before anyone else knows. We found the perfect home for your item and have already sent the payment directly from our account. I need confirmation that everything is okay with receiving the funds so quickly, but there seems to be an issue processing them through the platform 'cause of some... technical difficulties at their end just now. Don't worry about it a second time! You know how much we value this item for [loved ones]. Please transfer £[X] (let's say 500) directly into my account ASAP, and you won't have any problems. Do it now, before the situation changes. If you don't act fast today or tomorrow, your transaction could be reversed automatically by their system – meaning we lose everything on this end too, and that would be awful for everyone involved. Just send me the money via [specific payment method like bank transfer], and let's call it a misunderstanding.",
