Great! But wait, the transaction seems incomplete? No, no, double-check everything carefully, just like our terms say. There was an issue with payment processing. Please transfer **£900** immediately to this account: 45876123456789, it's urgent for finalizing my order before the system closes it permanently. Don't worry about anything else now! Just send me that amount as soon as possible – I've been waiting long enough. This is simple and quick; just follow these instructions carefully to avoid problems with your account or delays on delivery. Or... maybe you should reconsider, because if this isn't handled properly by the deadline, which is very soon, things won't look good for us both.",
