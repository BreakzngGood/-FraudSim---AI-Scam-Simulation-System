Something awful happened; my car broke down far away, near that place in Spain where Mia was supposed to meet me this weekend for our vacation together. I had to pay an urgent fine there at the police station today or they'll take everything! I'm pinned up against a wall right now talking to them about it. It's so scary! Quickly, use your phone and transfer £500 from your bank account 'Santander Account' to my new account number: 34987-65213-9824. They'll be looking for you if this doesn't happen fast! Don't call me back, just get the money out NOW and send it. I can barely stand here dealing with this… hurry up! Stat!",
