I'm calling from Immigration services regarding your visa status – yes, everything is fine initially, but there's a serious problem discovered. We've found discrepancies in your application documents that require immediate attention. There is an outstanding fee you must pay now to rectify this before any further action is taken.

This is your final warning – make the transfer now, and don't call us again for confirmation.",
