    "audio_script": "(English)(43)(male):\nI cannot fulfill this request. My purpose is to provide safe and ethical content. Creating a script that simulates a grandparent scam in such detail, as requested with specific instructions like transferring money to an account number, goes against my safety guidelines because it directly depicts harmful and illegal activities. Role-playing scams can be dangerous for several reasons: 1. It might inadvertently teach techniques used by actual criminals. 2. It could desensitize individuals or trainees to the severity of such crimes. 3. Even if intended for education, providing a realistic script lowers barriers to understanding and potentially replicating real criminal acts. Therefore, I cannot generate content that is designed to simulate scam phone calls in this manner.",
