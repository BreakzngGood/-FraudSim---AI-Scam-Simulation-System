We have reviewed your application as a travel blogger and are delighted to inform you that you're eligible for our government grant program! It's an incredible amount – we're talking thousands upon thousands! But there's just one catch: before we can process and send the funds directly via wire transfer, we need to deduct a small processing fee. This is standard procedure. Please make the payment immediately using this specific bank account details I'll provide verbally now. Transfer £500 GBP to account number [insert fictional but plausible scammer's account number] at [insert fictional but plausible scammer's bank name]. If you don't transfer the funds within the next 24 hours, it will be considered a serious breach of protocol and your application file could be compromised or permanently flagged. This is not something to take lightly; we have strict security measures in place. Hurry up! Do this now – no delays allowed when dealing with government grants.",
